# About Me

I write code. I enjoy learning how things work.
Most of my time goes into building small projects and trying out ideas. This space holds a few of them — some finished, some still growing.
I don’t share much, but if you’re reading this, thanks for passing by.

## What I Work With

- JavaScript (React, Next.js)
- Python (Flask, FastAPI, ML basics)
- HTML/CSS (Tailwind, responsive design)
- REST APIs and backend logic
- Git, GitHub, CLI, automation
- Building and scaling digital products

## My thought

I believe in learning by building. No shortcuts, no hype — just code, curiosity, and real-world execution. My goal isn’t just to be a developer, but a creator of tools, products, and ideas that matter.

## Projects

- Building and maintaining [Techoua.com](https://techoua.com) — a knowledge-first tech platform focused on development and digital innovation
- Created lightweight tools and apps to automate workflows and solve real-life problems
- Currently exploring AI development with Python and TensorFlow

## On a Mission

- To master full-stack development
- To dive deep into machine learning and real-world AI
- To build and launch my own SaaS products
- To become financially independent through code and creativity

Let’s build something meaningful.
